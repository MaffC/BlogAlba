Hi! I'm Matthew Connelly, best known as Maff.

I'm a Systems Administrator, hobbyist photographer and scripting fanatic from Scotland. I currently manage infrastructure at [IPXcore][1] and work on (mostly Perl) [projects][2] in my spare time. My current "constantly improving" project is my home network, which I've added multiple access points to, and have set up external monitoring for my OpenWRT-based hardware through [Munin][3], for which I've developed the [openwrt-munin-node][4] project. As well as this, I've worked on other projects including a [daemon][5] for monitoring directories and performing actions on files added to them, and a [basic blogging system][6] which powers this site.
